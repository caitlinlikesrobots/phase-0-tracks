Ruby Completions
================

Thank you for installing Ruby completions. This is aa simple Ruby package for sublime text that provides completion suggestions mostly for methods and when importing(requiring) packages/modules.


Usage
=====

Typing normally shows method suggestions. Pressing tab will complete it.
To use completion features when requiring a gem/package, type `R-` followed by the name and press `ENTER` or `TAB`.

	For example, to require 'cmath', type R-cmath and press enter or tab and the require would be completed.
