* MY PLAN TO TACKLE JQUERY:
  * Find a few great cheat sheets on jQuery to explore and play with on Chameleon site
    Timebox: 1 hour [was actually a couple hours... of fun!]
  * Resources: 
  1. https://oscarotero.com/jquery/  <--- This guy worked great!
  2. http://makeawebsitehub.com/jquery-mega-cheat-sheet/
  3. http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/jQuery-1.5-Visual-Cheat-Sheet.pdf

  * I plan on stopping every time I decide to practice a bit of code to see if that works. This should be about every 10 minutes or so. Breaks are incredibly important for focus and retention.
