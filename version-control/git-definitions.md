# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
*Version Control* is a workflow tool that allows you to track changes or modifications to your code as well as revert back to pre-modified code that might have been altered in a way you were too excited about. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
*Branches* are copies of the master file that allowed to be edited independently so that the master code isn't interrupted or corrupted. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
*Commits* are commands that solidify the changes made to the code with messages that convey what changes were made as specifically and succinctly as possible. A good commit message describes what actions were taken and what modifications it made to the master file. 
* What is a merge conflict?
*Merge Conflict* are when two people are making modifications to the same file and creating conflicting alterations to that file.
